# Javascript Calculator

This project is for a challenge on the beta site of the [freeCodeCamp](beta.freecodecamp.com) __Front End Libraries__ Challenges.
It is a simple Javascript calculator built with React and Redux, with unit tests created with Jasmine. The unit tests attempt to cover all of the tests from freeCodeCamp, broken into single responsibility tests.
